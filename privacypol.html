        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of Our Site. Our Site may contain links to other websites. Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.</p>
        <h2>4. What is Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.
            Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
        <h2>5. What Are My Rights?</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:
            <br>
            a) The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details above.<br>
            
            b) The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 13 will tell you how to do this.<br>
            
            c) The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details above to find out more.<br>
            
            d) The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details above.<br>
            
            e) The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.<br>

            g) The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.<br>
            
            h) Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this way.<br>

        <h2>9. How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>We will only store or transfer your personal data in the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the GDPR. The security of your personal data is essential to us and to protect your data, we take a number of important measures, including the following:<br>

            If any of your personal data is required by a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 9.
            
            If for any legal reason any personal data is ever transferred outside of the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR, as explained above in Part 9.</p>
        <h2>11. How Can I Control My Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>In addition to your rights under the GDPR, set out in Part 5, when you submit personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict our use of your personal data. In particular, we aim to give you strong controls on our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in our marketing emails OR at the initial point of providing your details by not giving your permission for marketing emails on the contact form.

            You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (“the TPS”), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (“the CTPS”), and the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications that you have consented to receiving.</p>

        <h2>13. How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.

            All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown above. There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is 'manifestly unfounded or excessive' (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.
            
            We will respond to your subject access request normally within 14 days and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
